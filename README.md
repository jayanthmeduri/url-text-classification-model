This project focuses on detecting spam URLs and spam messages using machine learning models. The app is built using Streamlit for the web interface and utilizes various machine learning algorithms to classify URLs and messages as spam or not. The URL and message features are extracted and used to train the model, which can then predict whether a URL or message is spam.
